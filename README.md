# FullStack-ClarusWay
This repository showcases my journey to becoming a FullStack Developer, featuring JavaScript and HTML projects from my bootcamp. It's a record of my progress and a personal resource to revisit as needed. The repo will evolve with examples from beginner to advanced levels. I hope it serves as both a milestone and inspiration for other learners!
